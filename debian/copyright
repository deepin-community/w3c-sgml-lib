 Schemas (and DTDs) are frequently part of our specifications and
 seemingly fall under the document copyright terms. However, as long as
 you do not use the same formal namespace or public identifier to
 identify that modified W3C schema/DTD (which might confuse
 applications), you may treat the schema/DTD under the software terms.
 This means that you are permitted to make a derivative or modified W3C
 schema/DTD, but even under the software terms you are obligated to
 include/retain the W3C copyright notice. We further appreciate a couple
 sentences regarding who made the modifications, when, and what changes
 were made in the original DTD -- a common software documentation practice.

 However, if no specific license exists for such a DTD or schema, as
 long as you do not use the same formal namespace or public identifier
 to identify that modified W3C schema/DTD (which might confuse

 terms. This means that you are permitted to make a derivative or
